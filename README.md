# OpenSourceCondo

A structural design concept for a removable condo (Also a grand plan to fix the housing shortage and increase social mobility)

Got a new job opportunity, and need to work in another city for 3 months? Why break a lease, when you can just create a new system for parking a condo?

Reduce building costs by 2/3rds- mass produce the components needed to assemble and construct a building. Standardize everything- window repair, insulation, hydraulic jack, heat pumps, water hookups, staircases, so whenever something needs replacement, it doesn't require a local contracter, since they might not be available. All the repair tools can be driven from out of town if unavailable, since the blueprints would be open-sourced.

Don't like your neighbor? Vote with your feet, and a hydraulic lift!

The primary and essential function of housing, to provide a safe and sheltered
space, is absolutely fundamental to the people’s health and well being.

"It’s one thing to fail to plan for extreme weather and climate impacts. It’s another to actively impede them and even make it illegal to consider climate impacts in real estate planning (don’t look up!). That’s what North Carolina’s Republican supermajority appears to have done over and over, at the behest of developers who wanted fewer regulations, more land to build on, and no guardrails to protect against some of the destruction we’re seeing in that state right now. Not my normal vibe, I know, but just like we need every solution, we also need to understand that our votes matter, that our resilience is local, and that every future decision that doesn’t take climate risk into account is a decision that puts you and your family in danger."

From my post-scarcity [respository](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Post-scarcity):
_"Imagine you have a slow -moving, Catgeory 5 hurricane in the Caribbean. Northbound, it is expected to reach the southern shores of Florida in days. A condo highrise has removabable condos, and all the units can be emptied from the frame structure, and temporarily moved upstate or under ground. See my blog [post](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Biology/blob/main/I%20wrote%20to%20Freeman%20Dyson%2015%20years%20ago%3B%20he%20responded%20nicely.pdf
) on a letter I wrote to Freeman Dyson in 2008."_

According to Congressional polarity, Republicans want extra land to build without regulations, and Democrats are against additional land. However, both appear to be glaringly missing a third option, resusable space in the form of portable condos with buildings that can be emptied in the event of an oncoming storm. While a tornado can appear out of nowhere, a hurricane and some wildfires _can_ be avoided with portable condos. The insurance legalese calls this "[Act of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God)". In my first trip to DisneyWorld in 1992, [Hurricane Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew) struck, and most southern Floridians drove upstate, where all the hotels and motels and motels had no vacancy. 

This would reduce insurance premiums, because large areas of Florida and California are uninsurable, or require FEMA insurance, due to (wild) fire, hurricane, tornados (midwest). So what exactly are insurance companies and climate planners doing when they are encouraging construction of buildings in areas with a high probability of a hurricane, such as in much of Florida, Louisiana, Texas ([Galveston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Rita) and the South-eastern coast, as can be seen by Hurricane Helene?

The word "resilience" and "adaptation" is not taken literally enough or fast enough.

As Mario Andretti [once](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13356-if-everything-seems-under-control-you-re-not-going-fast-enough) [said](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6280176081998143), “If everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.”

The irony is that single casting for automotive frames are prohibitively uninsurable, due to the cost of replacement- cheaper to produce (assuming no accidents), but far more expensive to insure, because, a dent will cause it to be totalled...

Some Bing AI images generated with DALL-E for an old idea

from https://sites.google.com/site/theoriginalepcot/project-vs-reality/the-contemporary-resort :

"Approximately 500 guest rooms line the outer walls of this building. Room renovation should have been a simple matter of replacing modules when refurbishment was needed; however, it was found that the modules settled and became stuck in place, rendering them irremovable. Most of Disney's Polynesian Resort was built this way also."

The winter probably makes the condos hard to dislodge. Some lubrication wouldn't be a bad idea. Most Craftsman cabinet drawers probably use some similar type. A dishwasher has a rollable rack. Really no reason the weight tolerances can't be simulated before the optimum preventative sagging limit is determined. The condo rails could leave an additional few centimers between the walls to wheel back and forth periodically (2-3 months) so that it is not stationary for long periods of time and rusts.

Like Carvana, but for Condos

https://www.yesterland.com/contemporary.html

"WW: Aside from demonstrating a concept, what advantage would there being in
building the rooms in a factory?
JK: This type of construction was attractive to the company because, in theory, it
would cut the building time in half. They were battling tight deadlines to get the
Vacation Kingdom built on time. By 1970, all the available 1972 convention dates
for the Contemporary had already been booked, so a delay was unthinkable.
Usually, you built a structure and then the rooms. By doing both at the same time
and then combining them, it would save time and money. It ended up doing
neither. U.S. Steel estimated the cost for each room would be $17,000, but the final
cost was over $100,000 a room in 1971 dollars. So imagine building a new updated
room at 2010 costs and then the additional cost of installing it."

If you read the above article about Yesterland, you might conclude and concur that the construction of the Contemporary Resort was never intended to be modular. And you are correct. However, this isn't the purpose of this repository. It's to explore the feasibility of a portable condo with an elevator. I research the possible, not the impossible. And I definitely don't base research on one-time experiments. What starts as a rumor has no less value to a good idea than one that meets conventional architecture. 

"“If you have everything under control, you're not moving fast enough.” — Mario Andretti. 

I am not someone who thinks there is necessarily a dream job for everyone. What I do believe though, is that there are many great opportunities that get ignored because the cost of relocation is too prohibitively expensive, either because the duration of the job is too short or too long (and too pricey for a short term rental). And I do not think that makes for a good economy, both for individuals, and national economies. Many people invest in homes as a source of value appreciation, but the low percentage of home-ownership does not indicate a good metric for a prosperity. I think reducing debt is a greater indicator of prosperity, but also increases the ability for individuals to invest in new enterprises. If everyone is paying off a 30-year underwater mortgage, what's the value in that? Therefore I think it's wise for construction firms to allow individuals to pursue both short and long-term jobs, but to be able to spend minimal time moving. Not every town has a hotel or rental property that one can move in and out for months- and even if it were, is it worth the $100=$250 a night? Being able to move fast enough, as in the Andretti quote, is all about allowing people to have everything under control. 

The problem is that most researchers aren't interested in history and might only read [headlines](https://margaretsullivan.substack.com/p/when-drudge-has-a-better-headline) and conclude what the research stated. But all that proves is that real innovation often gets overlooked, because no one is interested in testing a theory that was never even developed.

"About 10 years ago, when people probably had more attention span than they do now, a survey from a respected organization concluded that the majority of Americans read only headlines.

It was probably worse than that then — who wants to admit to such superficial habits, after all? — and it’s probably much worse than that now.

That’s one reason headlines matter a lot. It’s as far as most people get. The nuances of a story, no matter how much they may matter to reporters and their editors, don’t always break through. Headlines do."

As in anything in life, do you your own research.

If you're questioning why I would ask Bing this, you should also ask why Bing would allow me to make this query.

Yes, some of these generations are extremely impractical. Some are comical.

I prefer to generate ones that aren't entirely impractical. Perhaps this is a labor of evolution.
